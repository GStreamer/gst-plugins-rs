# gst-plugin-rs [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/gst-plugin.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/gst-plugin) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sdroege/gst-plugin-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sdroege/gst-plugin-rs)

Infrastructure for writing [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)
plugins and elements in the [Rust programming
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and a collection of various GStreamer
plugins.

Documentation for the crate containing the infrastructure for writing
GStreamer plugins in Rust, [`gst-plugin`](gst-plugin), can be found
[here](https://sdroege.github.io/rustdoc/gst-plugin/gst_plugin/). The whole
API builds upon the [application-side GStreamer bindings](https://github.com/sdroege/gstreamer-rs).
Check the README.md of that repository also for details about how to set-up
your development environment.

Various example plugins can be found in the [GIT repository](https://github.com/sdroege/gst-plugin-rs/). A blog post series about writing GStreamer plugins/elements can be found [here](https://coaxion.net/blog/2018/01/how-to-write-gstreamer-elements-in-rust-part-1-a-video-filter-for-converting-rgb-to-grayscale/).

For background and motivation, see the [announcement
blogpost](https://coaxion.net/blog/2016/05/writing-gstreamer-plugins-and-elements-in-rust/)

Note that the overall implementation has changed completely since those
blogposts were written.
