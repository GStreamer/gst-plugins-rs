//! A `runtime` for the `threadshare` GStreamer plugins framework.
//!
//! Many `GStreamer` `Element`s internally spawn OS `thread`s. For most applications, this is not an
//! issue. However, in applications which process many `Stream`s in parallel, the high number of
//! `threads` leads to reduced efficiency due to:
//!
//! * context switches,
//! * scheduler overhead,
//! * most of the threads waiting for some resources to be available.
//!
//! The `threadshare` `runtime` is a framework to build `Element`s for such applications. It
//! uses light-weight threading to allow multiple `Element`s share a reduced number of OS `thread`s.
//!
//! See this [talk] ([slides]) for a presentation of the motivations and principles,
//! and this [blog post].
//!
//! Current implementation uses a custom executor mostly based on the [`smol`] ecosystem.
//!
//! Most `Element`s implementations should use the high-level features provided by [`PadSrc`] &
//! [`PadSink`].
